### **Step 2: Initiating the Order Process**

1. **Send Order Request**:
   - Using Postman, send a POST request to `order-service` with a JSON payload for the wallet input.
   - The order is initialized in `OrderDomainServiceImpl` and saved via `CreateHelper`.
   - A `PaymentOutboxMessage` is created and stored in the database.

2. **Return Response to User**:
   - `CreateOrderResponse` with a tracking ID is returned to the user, indicating the order's initial creation.

### **Step 3: Payment Processing via Kafka**

1. **Outbox Scheduler**:
   - The `PaymentOutboxScheduler` identifies the `PaymentOutboxMessage`, then it will send the outbox message to message bus via `OrderPaymentEventKafkaPublisher`.
   - `OrderPaymentEventKafkaPublisher` then sends the eventPayload (extracted from outbox message) to Kafka, and the status is updated to `completed` upon Kafka's acknowledgment.

2. **Payment-Service Receives Event**:
   - `payment-service` listens to the payment request event.
   - The payment is processed, and a corresponding `OrderOutboxMessage` is created in the payments database.
   - Scheduler publishes the outbox message to Kafka via `PaymentEventKafkaPublisher`.
   - Upon Kafka acknowledgement, the outbox message status is updated to `completed`.

### **Step 4: Update Order Status to Paid**

1. **Order-Service Receives Payment Confirmation**:
   - `order-service` listens for the payment response.
   - Once received, it processes the successful payment and updates the order status to `paid`.
   - An outbox message is created for the next step, which is order approval, in order_approval_outbox table.
   - Update the outbox message in payment_outbox table to saga status "PROCESSING"

### **Step 5: Approval by Restaurant-Service**

1. **Send Approval Request**:
   - `RestaurantApprovalOutboxScheduler` in `order-service` identifies the approval message.
   - This message is published to Kafka using `OrderApprovalEventKafkaPublisher`.
   - Upon successful Kafka acknowledgement, the message status is updated to `completed`.

2. **Approval by Restaurant-Service**:
   - `restaurant-service` listens for the approval request and approves the order.
   - An outbox message is generated and stored in order_outbox of restaurant schema.
   - Scheduler picks up the message and send the outbox message to message bus via `RestaurantApprovalEventsKafkaPublisher`
   - `RestaurantApprovalEventsKafkaPublisher` then sends the eventPayload (extracted from outbox message) to Kafka, and the status is updated to `completed` upon Kafka's acknowledgment.

### **Step 6: Final Approval in Order-Service**

1. **Receive Approval Response**:
   - `order-service` listens for the restaurant approval response.
   - Once received, the order is marked as `approved`, and the saga is considered completed.

2. **Update Databases**:
   - The relevant outbox messages in `order-service`, `payment-service`, and `restaurant-service` databases are marked as `completed`.
   - The order database reflects the final `approved` status of the order.

### **Step 7: Archival and Clean-Up**

1. **Outbox Table Clean-Up**:
   - Completed outbox messages are cleaned up by dedicated schedulers to ensure performance.
   - Optionally, in production, these messages may be archived for future analysis.

2. **Final Checks**:
   - Confirm the following in respective tables:
     - `order-service`: Order status is `approved`.
     - `payment-service`: Credit entry reflects customerâ€™s balance, with history showing the transaction.
     - `restaurant-service`: Order approval table shows the order as approved.
   - Kafka topics can be inspected (e.g., using `kafkacat`) to view messages and confirm IDs.

This cycle efficiently processes an order from creation through payment, approval, and finalization across distributed services using Kafka for messaging and outbox patterns to ensure reliability and consistency.
