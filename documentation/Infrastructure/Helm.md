Let me explain the difference between these two components and their purposes:

### Kafka Client
- A Kafka client is a utility pod/container that provides Kafka command-line tools and utilities
- It's used to:
  1. Create and manage Kafka topics
  2. Test Kafka producers and consumers
  3. Execute Kafka-related administrative tasks
- In your setup, it's deployed using `kafka-client.yml` and is primarily used to create topics using the `create-topics.sh` script

### Helm/cp-helm-charts
- This is Confluent Platform's Helm chart that deploys the entire Kafka ecosystem
- It includes:
  1. Kafka brokers
  2. ZooKeeper (for Kafka coordination)
  3. Schema Registry
  4. Kafka Connect
  5. Other Confluent Platform components
- It's a production-grade deployment solution for running Kafka in Kubernetes

### Why do we need both?

1. **cp-helm-charts** (Deployed first):
```bash
helm install local-confluent-kafka helm/cp-helm-charts
```
- Sets up the actual Kafka infrastructure
- Creates the message broker system
- Manages the core Kafka services

2. **kafka-client** (Deployed after):
```bash
kubectl apply -f kafka-client.yml
```
- Acts as an administrative tool
- Used to interact with the Kafka cluster
- Needed for tasks like creating topics, testing connections, etc.

### Analogy
Think of it this way:
- **cp-helm-charts** is like setting up an entire post office (the infrastructure)
- **kafka-client** is like having the tools to create mailboxes and manage mail routing (the administrative interface)

You need both because:
1. The Kafka infrastructure needs to exist (cp-helm-charts)
2. You need tools to interact with and manage that infrastructure (kafka-client)
